Example Installation in a Nutshell:
====================================

1)  Type 'make -f Makefile.cvs'

2)  Type './configure'

3)  Type 'make'

4)  Type (as root) 'make install'

Example Installation in More Detail:
=====================================

0)  Make sure that the prerequisite KDE 3.2 development libraries and
headers are installed first. These can be found at
<http://www.kde.org>.

1)  Unzip and untar the package into its own directory. Change into
this directory, and read the README file. (I'm assuming that
you've read this, the INSTALL file :-))

2)  Type './configure --help", and peruse the configure options
available. It may be necessary to use one or more of these options
on your system.

3)  Type './configure' to configure the software for your system. If
you're using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need
to type sh ./configure' instead.

4)  Type 'make' to compile the package.

5)  If you are not logged in as root, type 'su' and enter the root
password to switch over to the root account. This is not necessary
if you configured the software to install to your home directory/

6)  Type 'make install' to install the software.

7)  Activate the styles, decorations and color schemes through the
KDE Control Center or the Preferences menu.

8)  You can uninstall the software by typing 'make uninstall'.

A Note on the KDE Library
========================

If you are having problems configuring the software, first make sure
that the required KDE 3.2 or greater libraries are installed. Several
systems have broken this into several packages. You will need both
the runtime and the development packages.

If you still have problems, set the KDEDIR environment variable and
the --prefix configure option to the location where you installed
KDE. Also make sure that you are using GNU make and not the standard
make everyone else uses.

Rebuilding the Configuration
============================

If you ever need to rebuild the configuration files, type the
following in thebase directory of the distribution:
    make -f Makefile.cvs

You will need the current automake/autoconf set of programs.
