+ ToDo
	+ Progress bar stuff ...
	+ Menu coloring
	+ centering / sizing
	    + notebook tab size/center
	+ pre-lighting
	    + button text (as well)
	+ Colors
	    + take from theme ...
		http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/qpalette.html
	    + alpha on menu check-buttons ...
	+ Theme name / color / selection / xsettings etc. (?)
		+ cross-desktop default usage [!?]
	+ Menu items
		+ Render the outline on selection / colors.
		+ insensitive items look awful.
	+ scroll-bars
		+ selected bg
		+ look when adjacent to step button
	+ Combo boxes
		+ pen color bleed from CC_ComboBox - check ?
	+ Tests:
		+ active vs. insensitive
		+ Buttons - with drop-down
		+ RTL geometry ...
		+ insensitive everything.

+ WM issues
	+ copy bluecurve & re-color (?)

+ Open issues:
	+ can we clobber the theme easily
		[ some environment variable or something ? ]
	+ Can run apps with -style Industrial (eg.)
	+ bg style / contrast foo ...
	+ Menu items
		+ no introspection possible
			+ only 'isChecked' not 'isCheckable'
			+ no 'isRadio' either.
	+ Button focus rendering [ butt ugly ]
		+ Qt doesn't expose sufficient power to be
		  able to render a 1 pixel stippled dotted
		  line
		+ Qt hides 'focus rect' rendering internally
		  and does something nastily broken.
		+ cf. http://primates.ximian.com/~michael/focus.png
	+ Re-sizable pane dividers (splitters)
		+ typically render an outline in Qt, never do
		  in gtk ( rely on the pane to do that )
	+ Ugliness in pre-lighting - state for it,
		   but not used - some vicious nightmare.
	+ Combo boxes
		+ drop-down frame border ...
		    + hard-black, a result of
		      qcombobox.cpp: setFrameStyle (box | plain) mess (?)
	


+ Colors
	+ ToDo
		+ 'contrast' setting ...
		+ Active/Inactive Title Button setting ?

+ Qt theme ...
	+ downloading all of Qt (for the demo)
	+ work out how to change themes
	+ start morphing QtCurve to Industrial
	+ Poke at gtk-qt-engine :-)
		+ KDE themes called 'styles
	+ 'client' - presumably for configuration of
	  the theme in the control center


KIndustrial:
	KindustrialClient : KWinInternal::Client
		+ does window frame bits ...
	KindustrialButton : KWinInternal::KWinButton
		+ rendering the window decoration buttons (all 5 ;-)


QtCurve:
	+ Much more beefy [!]
   + Settings:
	Yes	+ Border buttons, menus, etc.
	Yes	       + Rounded buttons
				+ all buttons / scroll-bars rounded

		+ Slider Thumbs
			+ Sunken - draws horiz lines on the slider
				 - we want a stipple
		+ Handles (?)

	No	+ Gradient buttons, scrollbars, etc.
	No	+ Gradient progress bars & selected menu items
	No	+ V style arrows
	Yes	+ Highlight background of check / radio button labels

		+ Default buttons
	No		+ Embolden text
	& Border Indicator


+ WM issues irrelevant for Qt under Gnome: abandon till later
    + WM decoration theming
	+ WM button state - stored separately
		+ goes into ~/.kde/share/config/kwinrc
		+ Need to savage
			+ /etc/opt/kde3/share/config/kwinrc
			+ bin the 'S' in 'ButtonsOnLeft'
			+ bin the 'H' in 'ButtonsOnRight'
		+ seems not to be per-theme ...
			+ Alternatively - we can hack them
			  out as they are added in the code ;-(
	+ lib/kde3/kwin3_quartz.so etc.
	+ cf. kdebase/kwin/clients/PORTING .
		+ KWinDecoration
	+ test with: 'kwin --replace &'
